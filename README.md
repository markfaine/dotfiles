# Dotfiles

This project contains dotfiles that can be used in both Ubuntu and Ubuntu on WSL2.

They are deployed by the `user` role in the [net.markfaine](https://github.com/markfaine/net-markfaine) Ansible collection.

The dotfile layout conforms to the convention used by [Tuckr](https://github.com/RaphGL/Tuckr) since that is what is used to manage dotfile symlinking.
